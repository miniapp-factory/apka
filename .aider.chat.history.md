Create a mobile app for cryptocurrency enthusiasts that allows users to track prices, monitor portfolios, and explore the crypto market in real time. The app provides interactive charts, news feeds, and AI-powered market insights to help users make informed decisions. Users can simulate trades, set alerts for price changes, and receive personalized tips based on their holdings and risk preferences. The interface should feel modern, sleek, and intuitive, with visualizations that make complex data easy to understand. Optional features could include a social feed for sharing trading strategies, collaborative watchlists, educational mini-courses on blockchain and crypto investing, and gamified achievements for learning or portfolio milestones. The unique value of the app is combining real-time market tools with AI guidance and community engagement, making crypto tracking and learning accessible, engaging, and dynamic for both beginners and experienced users.

I’ll need the current contents of the following files to make the required changes:

- `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`
- `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` (or create it if it doesn’t exist)

Please add those files to the chat so I can propose the exact edits.
